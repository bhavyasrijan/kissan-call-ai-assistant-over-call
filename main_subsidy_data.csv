"Crop Residue
Management","The key benefits of the Crop Residue Management scheme for farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and NCT of Delhi are:

1. **Mitigates Air Pollution**: The scheme aims to address the critical issue of air pollution caused by crop residue burning in these states. By promoting in-situ management of crop residue, it helps reduce the practice of stubble burning, which is a major contributor to air pollution. [1][4]

2. **Preserves Soil Fertility**: Burning crop residue leads to the loss of valuable nutrients and soil micro-organisms. The scheme encourages farmers to retain, incorporate or mulch the crop residues in the field, which helps preserve soil fertility and organic matter. [1][2][3]

3. **Financial Assistance for Machinery**: The scheme provides a 50% subsidy to farmers for the purchase of crop residue management machinery, such as happy seeders, mulchers, and paddy straw choppers. This helps offset the initial investment required for adopting these technologies. [1][3][4]

4. **Establishment of Custom Hiring Centers**: The scheme supports the setting up of Farm Machinery Banks or Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs) by cooperative societies, FPOs, and panchayats. These CHCs provide farmers access to crop residue management machinery at subsidized rates, making it more affordable for small and marginal farmers. [1][3]

5. **Awareness and Capacity Building**: The scheme includes information, education, and communication (IEC) activities to create awareness among farmers and other stakeholders about the importance of crop residue management and the available technologies and practices. It also provides training and demonstrations to build the capacity of farmers. [1][3]

6. **Promotion of Sustainable Practices**: By encouraging in-situ management of crop residue and exploring ex-situ utilization options, the scheme promotes sustainable agricultural practices and reduces the environmental impact of crop residue burning. [1][2][3]

Overall, the Crop Residue Management scheme aims to empower farmers in the target states by providing financial and technological support, while also addressing the critical environmental and soil health concerns associated with crop residue burning. [1][4]
